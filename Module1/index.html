            <p>A kitten is a juvenile cat. After being born, kittens are totally dependent on their mother for survival
                and they do not normally open their eyes until after seven to ten days. After about two weeks, kittens
                quickly develop and begin to explore the world outside the nest. After a further three to four weeks,
                they begin to eat solid food and grow adult teeth.</p>

            <p class="bold">Etymology and development</p>
            <p>The word "kitten" derives from the Middle English word kitoun, which in turn came from the Old French
                chitoun or cheton. Juvenile big cats are called "cubs" rather than kittens; either term (but usually
                more commonly "kitten") may be used for the young of smaller wild felids, such as ocelots, caracals, and
                lynxes.</p>
            <p class="bold">Nutrition</p>
            <p>Felines are carnivores and have adapted to animal-based diets and low carbohydrate inclusion. Kittens are
                categorized in a growth life stage, and have high energy and protein requirements.</p>
            <p class="bold">Pre-weaning nutrition</p>
            <p>Part of the kitten's immune system is the mucosal immune system, which is within the gastrointestinal
                tract. The mucosal immune system is largely responsible for coordinating proper immune responses by
                tolerating innocuous antigens and attacking foreign pathogens.</p>
            <p class="bold">Post-weaning nutrition</p>
            <p>Up until approximately one year of age the kitten is undergoing a growth phase where energy requirements
                are up to 2.5 times higher than maintenance. Pet nutritionists often suggest that a commercial cat
                food designed specifically for kittens should be offered beginning at 4 weeks of age.</p>
            <p class="bold">Diet Composition</p>
            <p>The lack of readily available glucose from the limited carbohydrates in the diet has resulted to the
                adaptation of the <span class="yellow"> liver to produce glucose from</span> the breakdown components of proteinâ€”amino acids. The
                enzymes that breakdown amino acids are constantly active in cats and thus, cats need a constant source
                of protein in their diet.</p>
